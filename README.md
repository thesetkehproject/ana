## Description

> Ana is a notification service named after my youngest daughter, Anastasia, meant to be used by

> well as other types of communications in the near future.  Ana is based on my original
> [GoBot](https://github.com/darthlukan/gobot) program and is effectively a rewrite of that "bot" with additional
> functionality and features


## Logging
> Ana can log IRC channels.

> Set the "LogDir" in config.json

> NOTE: the Directory Must be Writable by the user executing the bot.
